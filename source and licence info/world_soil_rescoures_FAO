# Description
The World Resource Base Map of World Soil Resources is available at 1:25 000 000 scale. This is the most general digital map of the World's soils, now using the international standard soil classification WRB. Available as a graphic or digital coverage.

Soil Type underpins the processes for estimating the changes in SOC as a result of changes to land use. Soil Type, when used in conjunction with climate data, is used for determining the IPCC Tier 1 SOC reference levels.
