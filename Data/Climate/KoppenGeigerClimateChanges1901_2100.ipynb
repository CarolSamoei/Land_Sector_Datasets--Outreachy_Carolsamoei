## Title: Koppen-Geiger Climate Changes - 1901 - 2100

### Description
Köppen climate classification is a widely used vegetation-based empirical climate classification system developed by German botanist-climatologist Wladimir Köppen. It's based on the idea that climate is best defined by native vegetation. This particular version of Köppen-Geiger shows the changes in the climate regions and biomes over time (from 1901 - 2100) using observations for 1901 - 2000 and the A1F1 IPCC climate scenario for 2001 - 2100. A1F1 is the worst case scenario future projection for climate change modeling. You can find out more information on how this was made by visiting World Maps of Köppen-Geiger Climate Classisification website.

### Notes
The original layers contain topological errors (non-simple geometry) - and an overlapping region at the international time/date line in three of the climate models that are fixed in the json using the below code. Also note, some scenario datasets are simplified polygon type converted from grid, others are direct polygon conversion from grid - as per original downloaded 19/12/2020. Gaps in data are water bodies and are valid.

### Processing
Repair geometry, fix topologial error (remove overlaps), convert to geojson, EPSG:4326 (WGS84), remove/disable Z values.
