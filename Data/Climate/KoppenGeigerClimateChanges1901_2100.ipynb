    "## Title: Koppen-Geiger Climate Changes - 1901 - 2100\n",
    "\n",
    "### Description\n",
    "Köppen climate classification is a widely used vegetation-based empirical climate classification system developed by German botanist-climatologist Wladimir Köppen. It's based on the idea that climate is best defined by native vegetation. This particular version of Köppen-Geiger shows the changes in the climate regions and biomes over time (from 1901 - 2100) using observations for 1901 - 2000 and the A1F1 IPCC climate scenario for 2001 - 2100. A1F1 is the worst case scenario future projection for climate change modeling. You can find out more information on how this was made by visiting World Maps of Köppen-Geiger Climate Classisification website.\n",

    "The original layers contain topological errors (non-simple geometry) - and an overlapping region at the international time/date line. Manual editting removed the few overlapping vertices.\n",

    "Repair geometry, fix topologial error (remove overlaps), convert to geojson, EPSG:4326 (WGS84), remove/disable Z values. View code below - originally processed in ArcGIS but can be converted to open source QGIS or GDAL (or others)."
