    "Dataset names: treecover2000, loss, gain, datamask, first and last\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Tree canopy cover for year 2000</b> (treecover2000) - Tree cover in the year 2000, defined as canopy closure for all vegetation taller than 5m in height. Encoded as a percentage per output grid cell, in the range 0–100. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Global forest cover gain 2000–2012</b> (gain) Forest gain during the period 2000–2012, defined as the inverse of loss, or a non-forest to forest change entirely within the study period. Encoded as either 1 (gain) or 0 (no gain). \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Year of gross forest cover loss event</b> (lossyear) Forest loss during the period 2000–2019, defined as a stand-replacement disturbance, or a change from a forest to non-forest state. Encoded as either 0 (no loss) or else a value in the range 1–17, representing loss detected primarily in the year 2001–2019, respectively. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Data mask</b> (datamask) Three values representing areas of no data (0), mapped land surface (1), and permanent water bodies (2).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Circa year 2000 Landsat 7 cloud-free image composite</b> (first) Reference multispectral imagery from the first available year, typically 2000. If no cloud-free observations were available for year 2000, imagery was taken from the closest year with cloud-free data, within the range 1999–2012. \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Circa year 2019 Landsat cloud-free image composite</b> (last) Reference multispectral imagery from the last available year, typically 2019. If no cloud-free observations were available for year 2019, imagery was taken from the closest year with cloud-free data, within the range 2010–2015.\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "tiles may contain no data if over the ocean, please see see datamask to mask waterbodies etc. Updates are intended so please check back at the original source(http://earthenginepartners.appspot.com/science-2013-global-forest/download_v1.7.html).\n",
